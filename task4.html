            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p> Digital STOPWATCH
                I was challenged to create a responsive stopwatch with a blur
                 background using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                 I'm proud to say that I was able to successfully design and develop a
                 functional stopwatch that not only looks great but also works
                 seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes. The blur
                 background effect adds a nice touch of modernity to the design</p>

            <p> FAST RAIL Ticket Booking Web Page
                Designed and developed a fast rail ticket booking web page using HTML,
                 CSS, and JavaScript. Created a responsive and user-friendly interface with a
                 left panel for navigation and a right panel for content. Implemented CSS
                 styles to achieve a modern and visually appealing design. Utilized JavaScript
                 to add interactive elements and enhance user experience. Successfully
                 created a functional web page that allows users to book rail tickets
                 efficiently. Demonstrated proficiency in front-end development and
                 problem-solving skills.
